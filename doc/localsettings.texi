@macro localhonorcodepolicy{}
Students are expected to follow the Honor Code in this class by refraining
from reading any homework solutions available online or elsewhere.  This
includes looking through other Pintos codebases.

Reading the source code for other operating system kernels, such as Linux
or FreeBSD, is encouraged, but do not copy code from them directly.  Also,
please cite the code that inspired your own in your design documentation;
we can share these references with other students taking the course in the
future.

@macro localcodingstandards{}
The codebase for this course follows a coding style like the CS11 C++ track
coding style, described here:
@uref{http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/cppstyle.html}.
Pintos uses only spaces for indentation, @strong{no tabs}, and 4 spaces per
indentation level.  Opening curly-braces are placed on the same line as the
statement that begins the block; closing curly-braces are placed on a
separate line.
